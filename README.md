# Surfs_Up

## Overview ##
  Our firm is very interested in opening up a series of ice cream / surf shops throughout the beautiful Hawaiian Islands. We are eyeing Oahu as our first location due to the fact that world renound surfer W. Avy regards it as the best place to surf, he also happens to be one of our top investors and has previous experience operating surf shops on the islands. One of Avy's top concerns was the weather, would it be too cold in the winter to utilize the ice cream portion of the ice cream / surf shop? That's where my team stepped in using the data recovered from the most utilized weather station on the islands we were able to get the average as well as the minimum and maximun temperature from pervious years to determeine wether or not this will be a worthwhile investment.
