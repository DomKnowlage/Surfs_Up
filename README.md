# Surfs_Up

## Overview ##
  Our firm is very interested in opening up a series of ice cream / surf shops throughout the beautiful Hawaiian Islands. We are eyeing Oahu as our first location due to the fact that world renound surfer W. Avy regards it as the best place to surf, he also happens to be one of our top investors and has previous experience operating surf shops on the islands. One of Avy's top concerns was the weather, would it be too cold in the winter to utilize the ice cream portion of the ice cream / surf shop? That's where my team stepped in using the data recovered from the most utilized weather station on the islands we were able to get the average as well as the minimum and maximun temperature from pervious years to determeine wether or not this will be a worthwhile investment.
  
  ## Results ##
  ![Decmeber Temperatures:](https://github.com/DomKnowlage/Surfs_Up/blob/main/December_Temps.png)
  ![June Temperatures:](https://github.com/DomKnowlage/Surfs_Up/blob/main/June_Temps.png)
  
  Three key differences are:
  1. The weatehr station has less counts in December then June
  2. Only 3 degrees seperates the average temp for both months
  3. It is slightly colder in December than in June (shocking I know)

## Summary ##
Overall I believe this to be a feasible business idea. With an averge temp that is seperated by 3 degrees in which the weather remains in the mid 70s i don't see any issues with us selling ice cream throughout the year. The data shows the lowest temp in December is roughly 56 degrees, a little cold to sell ice crean but think of thr location, Hawaii is a big tourist spot that people from all over the world flock to. I can certianly see some people from up in the colder climates and grabbing an ice cream in the boiling hot 56 dgreee farienheit heat. Also we will have the surf shop up and running regardless so if business is slow on one end we've always got the other.
